Kinnaird Castle and the nearby Winetower were described by W. Douglas Simpson as two of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire. Both buildings are category A listed buildings.»\\n[6] «Kinnaird Castle, Brechin | Kinnaird Castle is a 15th-century castle in Angus, Scotland. The castle has been home to the Carnegie family, the Earl of Southesk, for more than 600 years.»\\n\\nQuestion: How many storeys are in the castle that David Gregory inherited?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\\x1b[32m produce the answer. We need to identify the specific castle David Gregory inherited and then find the number of storeys it has. The context mentions that David Gregory inherited Kinnairdy Castle, which is described as having five storeys and a garret.\\n\\nAnswer: five\\x1b[0m\\n\\n\\n'"
